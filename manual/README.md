# Invasim: A Manycore Simulation Plarform

The following manual shown the different tools that need to be install in order to successfully run Invasim.

## Verilator
Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator, and outperforms most commercial simulators. Verilator compiles synthesizable SystemVerilog (generally not test-bench code), plus some SystemVerilog and Synthesis assertions into single- or multithreaded C++ or SystemC code. 
In Invasim, Verilator is used to generate the RISC-V processof model from the System Verilog RTL and then used it as a core in the simulation platform. It allows to execute RISC-V machine code.

### Installation
It is recommended to build it from **Git**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git make autoconf g++ flex bison   # First time prerequisites 
sudo apt-get install libfl2  # Ubuntu only (ignore if gives error)
sudo apt-get install libfl-dev  # Ubuntu only (ignore if gives error)
git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator   # Only first time
unset VERILATOR_ROOT  # For bash
cd verilator
git pull        # Make sure we're up-to-date
git tag         # See what versions exist
git checkout stable      # Use most recent release
#git checkout v{version}  # Switch to specified release version if stable doesn't work in project
autoconf        # Create ./configure script
./configure
make
sudo make install
# Now see "man verilator"
```

**NOTE:** The project was developed in Verilator 4.016 2019-06-16 rev UNKNOWN_REV

## RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain
This is the RISC-V C and C++ cross-compiler. It supports two build modes: a generic ELF/Newlib toolchain and a more sophisticated Linux-ELF/glibc toolchain.

## Installation
In order to install the toolchain correctly, there are some prerequisites that need to be install before On Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev
```
On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL OS:
```bash
sudo yum install autoconf automake libmpc-devel mpfr-devel gmp-devel gawk  bison flex texinfo patchutils gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel
```
### Sources
To download all necessary sources run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
### Pulp
To build the Newlib cross-compiler for all pulp variants, pick an install path. If you choose, say, `/opt/riscv`, then add `/opt/riscv/bin` to your `PATH` now. Then, simply run the following command:
```bash
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-arch=rv32imc --with-cmodel=medlow --enable-multilib
make
```
This will use the multilib support to build the libraries for the various cores (**riscy**, zeroriscy and so on). The right libraries will be selected depending on which compiler options you use. Invasim uses **riscy**.

## RI5CY: RISC-V Core
RI5CY is a small 4-stage RISC-V core. RI5CY fully implements the RV32IMFC instruction set and many custom instruction set extensions that improve its performance for signal processing applications. The core was developed as part of the [PULP platform](http://pulp.ethz.ch/) for energy-efficient computing and is currently used as the processing core for PULP and PULPino.
### Sources
To download all necessary sources run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv.git
```

In Invasim, it is found in folder **RI5CY**, and to generate the model run the following command in **RI5CY/verilator_model**:
```bash
Invasim/RI5CY/verilator_model $: make
```

This will generate the processor model in C++ to be used in Invasim.

### Basic Testbech
**RI5CY** has a set of testbenches, in order to run them RISC-V toolchain path must be exported in RISCV:
```bash
export RISCV=/opt/riscv-pulp
```
To run the basic test called **core**, which is in folder **Invasim/RI5CY/tb/core**, run the next commands:
```bash
cd RI5CY/tb/core
make
```
This will generate the models and compile tests, and then run all tests in the processor.
### Custom programs
In order to run custom programs in the model, the previous test should be run or at least compiled. In the same path, there is a folder called **custom** which contains a simple hello world in C. 
To compile this program, run the following command:
```bash
make custom/hello_world.hex
```
This will generate a hexadecimal file with Verilog's BCD, this should be loaded in memory running the testbench previously compiled:
```bash
./testbench_verilator "+firmware=custom/hello_world.hex"
```
**Note:** Once the program is finished, the testbench doesn't stop then use the terminate signal (Ctrl+C).

This starts the processor with the custom program. That program can be edited to explore other programs, and to create complex programs the *Makefile* shown how to compile them so they can be loaded in memory.

### Running benchmarks
Part of the development process was to test the core with different benchmarks to verify if the processor model works properly. This benchmarks are located in **RI5CY/tb/core/benchmark**, there are two:
* Codes: Benchmark provided by Jorge Castro-God√≠nez.
* MiBench: A free, commercially representative embedded benchmark suite.

In each folder there are different programs that test the processor model, in order to compile them each program has a **Makefile** that will generate a elf file and a hexadecimal file.
To execute the programs, the testbench and programs should be compiled before, then the testbech's firmware:
```bash
./testbench_verilator "+firmware=testbench/codes/fft/fft.hex"
```

**Note:** Once the program is finished, the testbench doesn't stop then use the terminate signal (Ctrl+C).

#### Tested benchmarks
The benchmarks were used to validate the processor model, due to limitations like no access to disk lectures and operating system support, some programs had to be excluded.
The following list are the programs that could be compiled and run in the RI5CY processor model. The codes benchmarks verify if the result is correct but MiBench doesn't then the result is compared with the output when running in a personal computer :
* **Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation**: This Code benchmark program can compile and passes the test when running.
* **Advanced Encryption Standard**: This Code benchmark program compiles and passes the test while running.
* **Fast Fourier Transform**: Both benchmarks have this program and both can be compiled and run. Code benchmark program passes the test.
* **JPEG Compression**: This  Code benchmark program can be compiled but it doesn't pass the test.
* **Matrix Multiplication**: This Code benchmark program compiles and passes the test.
* **Basic Math**: This MiBench program that make basic math operations compiles and generated the same outputs as a personal computer.
* **String Search**: MiBench program that searches words in sentences can be compiled and generates the same outputs as a personal computer.

The rest of the programs need access to disk, as the platform doesn't have a operating system it can be run.
